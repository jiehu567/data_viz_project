#Data Visualization Project

Need to come up with a good project for the data visualization class. I want to 
use D3 since I have been learning it on my own. 

To get the Bike data Use: https://s3.amazonaws.com/babs-open-data/babs_open_data_year_2.zip

To get the live feed: http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/stations/json *note that if accsesed more than once a minute one might get blocked*

**Update Jan 14** 

As of now my plan is to use the static data set to create a set of moving plots. For example map plot with counts of bikes at each station through out the day. Ideally the user will be able to select whether to see daily or monthly.
